Welcome to the world of mesh networking! This guide will help you get your first Meshtastic device up and running on the Acadiana mesh network.

## What You'll Need

### Hardware

- **Meshtastic-compatible device** (we recommend starting with a Heltec LoRa 32 V3 or T-Beam)

For beginners in the Acadiana area, we recommend:

1. **Heltec LoRa 32 V3** (~$25)

   - Great for getting started
   - Built-in OLED display
   - Easy to program and configure

2. **LILYGO T-Beam** (~$35)
   - Built-in GPS
   - Better battery life

## Step 3: Initial Configuration

1. **Connect your device** via USB or Bluetooth
2. **Set your region** to US (for 915MHz operation)
3. **Configure your node name** (keep it family-friendly!)
4. **Set your location** (helps with network mapping)
