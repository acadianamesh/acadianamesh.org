Acadiana Mesh is a community-driven initiative focused on building resilient mesh networks throughout Acadiana and Southern Louisiana using Meshtastic technology.

## Our Mission

We believe in the power of decentralized communication networks to:

- **Enhance Emergency Preparedness**: Provide reliable communication during natural disasters and emergencies
- **Build Community Resilience**: Create networks that work independently of traditional infrastructure
- **Foster Technical Education**: Share knowledge about mesh networking and radio communications
- **Support Local Communities**: Connect neighborhoods, rural areas, and underserved regions

## What is Meshtastic?

Meshtastic is an open-source project that enables you to use inexpensive LoRa radios as a long-range mesh communication platform. These devices can:

- Send encrypted messages without cellular or internet connectivity
- Create self-healing networks that route around obstacles
- Operate for weeks on battery power
- Cover distances of several miles in ideal conditions

## Get Involved

Whether you're a complete beginner or an experienced radio operator, there's a place for you in our community:

- **Join our Network**: Set up your own Meshtastic node and connect to the mesh
- **Attend Meetups**: Participate in local gatherings and technical discussions
- **Share Knowledge**: Contribute to our guides and documentation
- **Help Others**: Assist newcomers in getting started with mesh networking

## Coverage Area

- Lafayette Parish
- Acadia Parish
